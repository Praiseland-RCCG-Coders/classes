            <h1> My Biography - h1</h1> 
        
        <h2>How it started</h2>

        <p>My name is Keania Niate Eric and I am a Software Engineer currently working as a Freelancer. I freelance for agencies as well as startups looking for independent contractors to maintain their application or supplement their internal team. Today I have over 4 years of work experience and hold a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science (not one i am proud of actually just mentioning). In the course of these 4 years I have worked with companies in different parts of the world starting from companies in Port Harcourt, Lagos, South Africa, Denmark, Ireland and the US. To be honest I have gotten a bit more exposure than I anticipated this early. These exposures have grown me mentally, emotionally and financially. At some point they have all been experiences that have made my stay here in the last couple of years adventurous and interesting. But it wasn’t always like this. A little trip down memory lane to see how it got started.</p>

        <h2>My Family Background</h2>
        <p>I grew up in one of the roughest slums of Port Harcourt here and in my primary school days I would only see a computer in movies or at the back of a notebook. I knew nothing about computers except input process output , garbage in garbage out, that's all. I never was interested because it was all too abstract in my head. 

        </p>

        <h2>I was scared also</h2>
        <p>I was an introvert, hated the stage and down with low self esteem but I loved making  a difference in my world. I saw a series at the time called “Dark Angel” , a Jessica Alba movie and I loved the Logan character played by Micahel Weatherly and for me that was a Eureka moment. Oh I could be significant without being out there.I said to myself. I think that was the time I figured being  a programmer or as at the time a hacker would be great.
        </p>

        <h2>The Universe</h2>
        <p>It was like if you want something, the Universe conspires to bring it to you and following those months, was one of our then ministers, a father to one of my closest friends as at then, he would come to the teenage  church to tell us about how the world is moving towards IT. He kept ringing it in my ears until I decided I was going to get a laptop.</p>

        <h2>We were poor also</h2>
         <p>My family couldn’t afford me a phone so I won’t dare think of asking for a laptop plus the course of training as at then was on the high side. I focussed on getting a laptop first. I did home tutoring for 4 months so I could save up to get my first laptop which was more like a desktop (a television) as they call it. With the help of my friend “Samuel” I was able to get PDF books that taught programming. That's how the journey started, I barely had any knowledge of computer appreciation and I journeyed to learn what almost 80% of people I knew never understood.

            <h2>Decisions matters</h2>
<p>Following this decision were hard and happy days, I had to be writing codes on a notebook when there was no electricity and would be learning and reading while helping out my mum at the shop. I stay awake at night and most times my dad would shout at me to stop what I am doing and go to bed. I go weeks without data, I recall being stuck with a mysql embedded statement in PHP for 2 weeks not knowing how to go from here. Along the line I made some </p>         </p>
